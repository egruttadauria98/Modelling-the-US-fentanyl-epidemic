# Modelling the US fentanyl epidemic: a tool for policy intervention

## Abstract
With a great acceleration of deaths by fentanyl overdose during the CoVid-19 pandemic, the United States are battling against synthetic opioids being smuggled inside the country and its dramatic consequences. By trying to understand the dynamics driving the fentanyl epidemic in the United States using a compartmental model, precious insights could be provided to policymakers to counter the social and economic effects illicit drugs have on the country as a whole.

OfÔ¨Åcial data show that fentanyl-related overdose deaths have spiked after 2012. According to our model, the main parameters impacting this concerning increase are the extremely high prescription opioids addiction rates, the loose recovery rate and, of course, the deadliness of fentanyl (being 50 times more potent than heroin). Tailor-made policies should account for the sensitivity of the fentanyl epidemic system to these factors, trying not to focus on a prohibitionist approach. In fact, drug seizures and bans should be applied with care: a restrictive policy might even increase the number of fentanyl deaths by overdose in the long run.
